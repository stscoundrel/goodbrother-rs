# Goodbrother

List open PRs in Github by user. Rust port of original TypeScript library.

## Motivation

If you have many repos that receive regular updades with Dependabot, you're simply likely to miss some of them. I occasionally only found PRs when I get notification that they were closed in favor of a even newer version.

Goodbrother is there to let me know if I still have some open.

### Install

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
goodbrother = "1.0.0"
```
